- Suggested Next Feature: Shift Analytics Dashboard
For your next feature, I recommend implementing a comprehensive Shift Analytics Dashboard that provides real-time insights into labor allocation across jobs and departments. This would help management make data-driven decisions about resource allocation and productivity.

Key components could include:

Daily Activity Overview:

Real-time count of active workers by department
Total hours worked today across all jobs
Visual timeline of shift starts/ends throughout the day
Department Performance Metrics:

Hours logged per department
Job distribution across teams
Resource allocation visualization
Individual Productivity Tracking:

Employee shift patterns and consistency
Average hours per job type
Comparison to estimated hours on projects
Cost Analysis Tools:

Labor cost calculations per job
Variance from estimated labor budgets
Projected completion timelines based on current pace
This dashboard would complement your existing features like batch shift assignment and provide immediate value to supervisors and management by offering a bird's-eye view of all current work activity.


-For the next feature implementation, I recommend adding a Job Productivity Analysis tool that would:

Compare estimated hours vs. actual hours spent per job
Generate visual charts showing productivity trends by department
Highlight jobs that are nearing or exceeding their allocated time budgets
Allow managers to set time thresholds and receive automatic notifications when jobs approach those limits
Provide downloadable reports for management review
This would complement your current "Today's Activity" view by giving managers deeper insights into job efficiency and help with future project estimates.


-Building on the real-time data available, the next logical feature could be a Live Worker Map. This would:

Visually represent active workers on a simple floor plan or area map (if applicable).
Show which job each active worker is currently assigned to.
Allow managers to quickly see the distribution of labor across different locations or job sites in real-time.
Could potentially integrate with department data to show team concentrations.
This feature would provide an intuitive, visual way for managers to understand workforce deployment at a glance, complementing the statistical data already present on the "Today's Activity" page.


-Next Feature Suggestion:
Consider implementing a feature to display "Hours Logged Per Department" as mentioned in the feature-ideas.md file. This would provide a breakdown of logged hours by department, enhancing the dashboard's utility. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this!


-Feature Suggestion:
Implement User Profile Pages:

Create dedicated profile pages for each user.
Display user information (name, email, department).
Show a summary of the user's recent activity (e.g., last 5 shifts, total hours logged this week).
Allow users (or admins) to update profile information.
This feature would provide a centralized view of user details and their work patterns.
